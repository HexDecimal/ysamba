# World creation workflow
1. Generate terrain
2. Generate societies
3. Let player choose a predefined society
4. Let player choose starting location

# Society types
They change according to the geographical location
- Savants (a lot of old people)
- Warriors

Nomadic - worse equipment at start but better skills overall
Sedentary - better equipment but worse skills

# Gameplay
- Player's society can conquer others by force or by diplomacy
- Nearby societies have a more similar language and culture than those far away
- Investigate dummy language generation

# Gameplay loop
1. World creation
2. Society creation
3. Society management
  - Enslave someone
  - Free someone
  - Gather wood
  - Gather food
  - Gather water
  - Hunt
  - Cook
  - Build tools
  - Dig pit
  - Light fire
  - Resources dry out
  - Move to another location (nomadic)
  - Prepare soil to plant
4. Automate routine actions:
  - 1x day, 1x week, 1x month
5. Society can collapse if not well structured
  - Too much working hours
  - Not enough cohersive power (weapons strength)
  - Illegitimacy of rulers
  - Quantity of slaves
6. Increase of number of ppl leads to inventions of new technology
7. Collapse leads to spending materials, loosing ppl and modifying the society towards an equilibrium

TODO:
  - Consider cases when coord is on negative x or y

# Game loop
- Start as a nomad society
- Build stuff and eat while things start to run out
- You have to move to another location, you can't take everything
- Locations are pretty different
- Possibility of finding other societies that are hostile or friendly
- Each new location you can accumulate stuff until you're able to settle
- If someone dies you can bury them
- The game ends when all the members of your society died

- When you settle, you can farm and tame animals
- You can craft more advanced things
- You can slave or befriend people from other societies
- Sometimes people from other societies come to attack you

## Animals
- They can approach and attack
- Can be scared

## Different ppl
- Old people are knowledgable but weak
- Children and pregnant women need protection
